INFO: [Project 1-5579] Found utility IPs instantiated in one or more block designs which have equivalent inline hdl with improved performance and reduced diskspace. It is recommended to migrate these utility IPs to inline hdl using the command upgrade_project -migrate_to_inline_hdl. The utility IPs may be deprecated in future releases. More information on inline hdl is available in UG994.

WARNING: [SMARTCONNECT-2] Port M01_AXI of /axi_smc is connected to an infrastructure IP (/axi_apb_bridge_0).  It is recommended to attach AXI SmartConnect directly to endpoint IPs to avoid mismatches or other issues during validation.  If mismatches occur, manually assign values for AXI Interface properties of /axi_apb_bridge_0.
